TV Tracker App Notes


To Do


In watched episodes - add S#E# before episode title

In watched episodes - add date watched

Make show list editable

Saved show list - needs switch controller thing or some option implemented to view for added (bydate, alphabetical, lastwatched, etc)

Add error message in showSearch if internet connection is offline



__________

DONE - Don't let users add show that already exists (popup notification)

FIXED - in watched episodes - display in reverse order (add them in reverse order, since they are displayed with most recently added in the last array position)

FIXED - if you save a show then start marking episodes, you have to go all the way back to the main screen and "saved shows" to access the saved episode list - combined savedshowmenutableview into showmenutableview
